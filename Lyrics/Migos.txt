At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him

Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued

When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five

And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's

Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

Splash, drip, islands
Water, islands

Living on the islands

On the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game, wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my fleet
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my fleet?
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my fleet?
POW!

The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it !
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I'm a young rich nigga
I'm buying whatever no matter the cost
Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross

Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

Living on the islandsI done told all of these bitches

I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
I'm in way too deep with the digits
Falling in love with the Benji's

So deep in the game I might drown
I play with the fishes, no flounder
I sip on the Actavis, it keep me grounded
I was missing one thing but I found it (Money!!!)
You niggas ain't shit
You wanna see a nigga fall
But I stand tall
Locked up behind the wall
Making county calls
Remember the time when my teacher said I wouldn't make it?
I'm hungry, I know that the M & M's coming, I taste it

I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it

Falling in love with the Benji's

Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly

Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator

I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater (splash), you don't know how I'm feeling right nowMigo! (Migo we winnin', winnin')

Pocket salad, extra dressing
He always got a nigga flexing
Know that I have to get the Smith & Wesson

You gotta run with it and score a touchdown
If you wanna be a rap artist
Gotta take over your town (the city!)

I was broke I remember
I stashed it away in my memory
I know niggas that envy me, jealousy
Wondering how did I get rich with these felonies
God keep on telling me;
'Please just focus!'
I came from roaches to Lotus
They hung my brother like posters
The Lord he told me I'm chosen

Real street nigga that love to hustle, came from the gutta
My nigga be flexing, pressing
I'm fucking that bitch that you texting
You stressin? (Haha)
We just sitting in here counting cash, trying not to laugh
All of these presidents, OG gas
Sipping on Actavis out the glass

Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'(brrrt-brrrrt)
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working

White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)

Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks

I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra

Young rich niggas
Young niggas been doing real boss shit

Came in the game kicking doors, fucking hoes, and rocking gold (Don't act like you don't know that shit nigga)

Been having hoes (havin')
Been having niggas on go (havin')
For real (woop)
Ask about it

I’ma put on for my city (North)
You gon’ put on for these bitches
Young nigga I came from nothing
And now I’m at parties with Diddy
See at first they didn’t believe me
Now this shit coming way too easy
I’m with a paid assassin
Run to the money, we dashing (go get it)
We the ones came up with dabbing
We put ‘em on trap fashion
I made a play out in Athens
I’m whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu’fuckers say (shhh)
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap

I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Droppin my top just to dump out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

Some niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain’t talking ‘bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin’ and havin’
My niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally (so that’s a 60)
I would give you names of these Migos clones but it’s every rapper in the industry (literally)
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don’t let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas’ll envy me
Behind the lot shootin’ at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn’t know
People compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they’ll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it’s inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin’s
(hot, hot), the block is sizzling
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told ‘em north side wasn’t the trenches?
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain’t my fault, nigga, it’s your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
I bought twenty pints of Activis
You think I’m sellin’ em, but that’s just for me to sip it
If you don’t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me

Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin’s
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me’s
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch’ knees weak
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it’s up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I’m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy ‘cause they know that I’m a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon’ feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on Margiela one day, then Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don’t care ‘bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don’t fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I’m not being friendly, I don’t want to kick it
Didn’t write no letter, you niggas ain’t visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can’t fuck with us period
I see a million when I’m in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my Lear
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don’t get indictedMoney and the power, you gotta have respect

Baby I'm on the road
But it's all good, though
I love you, love you, I'ma call right back
That boy Cas
But it's all good, all good

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

Okay, I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain't never seen
The OGs keep telling me "boy, you gon' make history"
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man, we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes, I make her panties leak
She still probably won't believe, so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it's all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

Quavo talk to 'em, ooh
You know you're shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my God what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young nigga, ain't used to relations
So you know I ain't patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don't eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That's my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
I'm not used to cuffing the women but I'm gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though

That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane

Better back off my bitch young nigga or you might lose your life
Just me and her ridin round in my two-seater
We made plenty millions that was the first time I showed her the egg beater
Remember the time the police they lock me up and you buying me out
Remember that time they wanted you to talk and you close your mouth
That's why I fuck with you, I really can’t say I love you
But I do really fuck with you, like everything that you do and she know

My squad gon ride that’s because I trust em
If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain’t with us then my nigga fuck em
It’s a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
Only listen to my god and mama, that’s who made me
When my brother  called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can’t visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can’t see her going in

Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Swear to god if you touch my brother I ain’t gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers

I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace Ree-Ree and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely

But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle

He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed

Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle

Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis" (mama)
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity" (infinity)
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown

Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid

I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out

When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home

I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
The plug, he live in my mansion
He got bitches in the kitchen dancing
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit

Feeling like Jamie Foxx, ‘cause I’m in love with a bitch named Fancy
This game is dirty like a fucking Banshee
When I started getting money, now you can’t stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami

But this little bitch still gon’ creep on her toes

Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me

You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)

Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me

Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that

Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"

And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling

Mama got a nigga, I ain’t like his ass
Tried to make me rake the leaves and cut the grass
Nigga you ain't even got no kids, what make you dad?
If I wasn't 12 years old I’d bust yo ass!
Mama kicked him out and now I’m 21
Bought her Prada, Gucci, Louis, Christian Loubuitton
Mama taught me everything, I’m her Danielson
I had to go get her that Porsche before the summer’s gone
(Hook)
(Verse) (Gucci Mane)
I was servin junkies out my mama window
I was broke like half a brick, that was ‘96
Daddy gone so I guess that makes me head honcho
Mama ramblin through my closet, she done found a spliff
She said I raised you better, boy you’ve got a strong mind
She said I can’t believe you serve that to your own kind
I told her mama chill cuz I been broke along time
That’s why I’m at the store and junkies in a long line
I was a runner for my brother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs
First time I set shop on my block I didn’t get no luck
200 thousand for a Charger, 6’s, no scrub

Fuck the police we might start up a riot
This shit is so pitiful, had to pay money for my nigga's funeral
That was my nigga we had so much unity
I got in my heart, he on top and he smilin'
Used to talk about a fuckin' rivalry

Most of these bitches ain't mine

You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
I'm chasin' a nigga like Tom & Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
The birds they be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers

Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine

Most of these bitches ain't mine

You can have, she ain't mine
No, I don't want her
I don't want her
Yes she's foreign, I caught her in Barcelona
Got this Spanish lil' mama, like to drink Corona
But you can have her, she gon' instantly bend it over
Cuffin' bitches, I ain't worried 'bout it
Cause everybody know about it
I pulled up to my mansion in the Audi
Smashed and then she outtie
Say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rowdy
He told me that she goin' in, she got that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
I got her suckin' me up in a Benz
She told me she wanted a threesome
I told that lil' bitch call her friend
When I pull, light the light, the Forgis slide
You must be blind if this money you think ain't mine

Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mineZaytoven

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
Soon as we thanked our fans
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
They threw us in the paddy van (paddy!)
Shit, we all said, "Fuck it"
Whatever happen's God's plans

I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)

Offset!
I had to sit down once again in the pen
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Didn't do a show, but I still got my percent (cash!)
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleepin' one eye open, Silver without a patch (I see you!)
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Minor setback for a major comeback
Smokin' on gas, breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Face in my Backwood, I'm not tryna match
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia

I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
Should've caught a concussion
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
And I asked for the Ozium cause it was musty (spray!)
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
Now it's 'bout time to walk into the buildin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Promise we would not be in this predicament
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Went to the toilet, threw and flushed it down
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!

I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)

My diamond dancing singing El Dabarge
I treated my diamonds like beauty bars
My diamonds different colors, living colors
They be jumping around like a rock star
No Jackson 5 but it's 3 of us brothers
We keep the Nina now we pop stars
While you sitting there watch me on instagram
You can count the rings on my fucking hand

Young nigga searching for bags
Hurricane wrist been in task
We fucked up the kitchen
Sorry mama I did it we fucked up the kitchen

Mama I fucked up the kitchen
Sorry Steve Urkel I did it
Me and peewee pull up in the speed
Ni ni with the loader extention
Hoes in the kitchen cooking naked
I bet she won't take a gram
Im not the black eye peas
But i can't leave the peas like Will-I-AM

Cooking dope hit it with the turf
Country boy want a real erk
Choppa hit his ass murder murder
Longway and migo we on the block lurking
Me one connected we ?? of my search
Trapping og gas up out my bitch working
Giuseppe my toe and maybach with the curtain
And that one thing for sure and that two thing for certain
(Chorus)

The kitchen it make me a mili
I took that mili and bought me a Bentley
Fuck up the kitchen with a fork and a skillet
Ain't no competition my nigga we winning
Maison Margiela limited edition
Actavis sipping fucking up my kidneys
I put the boogers in my Breitling bezel
Young nigga looking like a pretty penny


Giuseppe stepper high top alligator
I flex on you niggas Arnold Schwarzenegger
QC is the label different flavor now or later
The choppa turned you to a harlem shaker
Don't fuck with them niggas that's ignorant
Trapping and getting it
I pull in the phantom
The ghost is a mystery
Migos the gang and my niggas made history literally
Pull in the rari from Italy
(Chorus)Woosh, pack gone missing

Huh, huh, huh, gone!

Yeah, fuck nigga, I just took the set, I just took the pot
Hit it with that Shaq' attack, slam dunk!
It's nothing but 33 Larry Bird's in the trunk
We trappin' and cappin' the top floor
White in the trunk, got it smelling like skunk
Gas, gas, they callin' up 12, we goin' mad
Here take all these pocket rockets bitch
Put 'em in yo Birkin bag
What you gon' do at the top floor?
Grab the parachute, hit the window
"Quavo, you tripping", hell naw

My diamonds they flyin' like Bobby and Whitney
Walking around with a 50
My bitch in the trap naked in the mansion no bra and no panties
You mad 'cause I'm rich
Cuffin' and loving that bitch
We smash and we switch
I pull up to bando with bricks in a Bent'
I stand 'round the trap like a fence
Finessin' I run with the money
I'm wrappin' and shippin' the dummy, Houdini me
